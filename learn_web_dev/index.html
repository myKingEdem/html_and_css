		Training programs such as General Assembly, gSchool, DevBootCamp and The Starter League that teach web development cost anywhere between $8,000 and $36,000. Not everyone can quit their jobs and attend these programs. If you've ever wanted to learn web development, but don't have the time and resources to attend these programs, this book will guide you through learning everything you need to know to become a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer. It uses rapid skill acquisition principles to help you acquire the skills necessary to become a proficient full-stack web developer, in record time.

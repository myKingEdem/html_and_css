	<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>
		<h3 class="topic">Ruby</h3>
		<p class="topic" id="ruby"> 
			Ruby is an object-oriented programming language that emphasizes simplicity and programmer productivity. Ruby's simple syntax and English-like readability makes it easier to learn compared to other languages.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3 class="topic">HTML &amp; CSS</h3>
		<p class="topic" id="htmlcss">
	 	Web developers use HTML tags to structure web pages and use CSS rules to make pages beautiful. HTML tells the browser whether a text is a link, table or image and CSS tells it what the font, color, or size should be.
	 	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3 class="topic">jQuery</h3>
		<p class="topic" id="jquery">
	 		jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to add animations, interactivity and visual effects to websites. In some ways, jQuery is an easier introduction to JavaScript.
	 	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3 class="topic">Sinatra</h3>
		<p class="topic" id="sinatra">
	 		You might know about Rails and its capabilities, but it's not always the right tool for the job. If you only want to serve a few web pages, Sinatra might be a better option. You are also free to structure apps as you see fit.
	 	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3 class="topic">Ruby on Rails</h3>
		<p class="topic" id="rails">
	 		Rails is designed to help web developers create web apps faster, with minimal configuration. Rails is used by many companies including Twitter, Yellow Pages, Hulu, Groupon and 37Signals to power web applications that are used by thousands of people world wide.	
	 	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3 class="topic">Testing with RSpec</h3>
		<p class="topic" id="rspec">
	 		It is imperative that you learn how to thoroughly test your code. Tests serve as documentation for your code, making it easier to add features, find bugs and work with others. Even if you plan to only develop software for personal use, you should still learn to test.
	 	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3 class="topic">Design Fundamentals</h3>
	 	<p class="topic" id="design">
	 		Every application has different design needs and the only way you can choose the best possible design for an application is to understand fundamental design concepts. Understanding design fundamentals will also make it easier for you to work with designers.
	 	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3 class="topic">Professional Development</h3>
	 	<p class="topic" id="practical">
	 		In addition to learning these technologies and related tools, you will learn how to apply for internships, apprenticeships or entry level positions as a Rails developer. You will also learn how to build your career and continue learning to maintain your edge.
	 	</p>
